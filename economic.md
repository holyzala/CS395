## The Economic Realities of Automation

While the most publicly discussed issues regarding self-driving cars are focused on the algorithmic decision-making of the car itself, an equally important discussion must be had around the social and economic impact of this level of automation.

From long-haul truckers to taxi drivers, the transportation industry is massive. And according to NPR's Planet Money podcast, [29 states have "Truck, delivery, and tractor drivers" as their most common job.](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/02/05/382664837/map-the-most-common-job-in-every-state) With the growth of self-driving cars, we will very quickly be faced with a question of what these people should do. For a while, as Uber has been doing, [there will be human “safety drivers” in the cars](http://www.theverge.com/2016/10/19/13341130/uber-travis-kalanick-self-driving-cars-automation-jobs), there to oversee the computer and provide a fallback in the case of equipment failure. But how long will this remain economically viable? When the safety of the car is such that the human inside stops paying attention—realizing that the car has things under control—then the utility of having the human in the first place disappears.

And automated cars are not the only industry that will be affected by this same technology. The exact same tech behind self-driving cars—computer vision, deep learning algorithms—are now also being applied by [Amazon for the creation of a new convenience store](https://www.amazon.com/b?node=16008589011), one that requires no humans to staff checkout lines. The store tracks every item that each person picks up using sensor arrays, and automatically bills the customer’s Amazon account when they leave the store. Amazon even states on their website for the store that it “is made possible by the same types of technologies used in self-driving cars: computer vision, sensor fusion, and deep learning.”

Indeed, [2013 report claims](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/519241/report-suggests-nearly-half-of-us-jobs-are-vulnerable-to-computerization/) that 45% of American employment is at risk of automation within 20 years.

Now, I'm not trying to argue against the deployment of this technology. Even if I thought that it should be stopped, at this point that's likely not possible. New technologies form a social pressure of inevitability. Automated cars could no more be stopped now than the spread of the personal computer in the 70s and 80s.

We are currently in a [post-industrial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-industrial_society) economic era. This is the period where the tertiary services sector of the economy begins producing more than the secondary manufacturing sector of the economy. The Industrial Revolution brought us from pre-industrial to industrial; globalization and automation, then, shifted the majority of economic income from manufacturing to services, which is the section of the market concerned with distribution of finished goods: transportation, point-of-sale. And these are exactly the jobs that the tech behind self-driving cars is promising to take over.

As these careers shrink, some people will certainly be able to re-specialize. But the cost of college is [incredibly high, and increasing much faster than general inflation,](http://www.forbes.com/sites/steveodland/2012/03/24/college-costs-are-soaring/#69bc4adf641b) which renders returning to school impractical for a huge segment of the population. And if the number of lost jobs reaches even half of that 45% projected rate, we would be looking at unemployment as bad as it was during the Great Depression. Realistically, there is no way for the other industries to generate enough new jobs to offset this loss.

One possible solution, and the one I believe in personally, is a shift away from capitalism to a system of democratic socialism. Currently, under our capitalistic society, a person's worth is valued in terms of their economic production. The poor are looked down on as freeloaders or lazy, when the reality is there are very complicated socioeconomic forces that push people into unemployment and poverty. Homelessness is also largely a [mental health issue](http://www.nationalhomeless.org/factsheets/Mental_Illness.pdf), yet is [criminalized](http://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/resources/criminal-defense/crime-penalties/what-a-vagrancy-charge) rather than treated. Our social perception is that someone who does not work and does not contribute to the economy is not valued as a human. This attitude is already harmful, but will become that much worse as more and more able-bodied, healthy, working-age people are pushed out of jobs through no fault of their own. To counter this, we ought to look to countries such as Sweden, where expanded social welfare programs have led to a [strong economy](https://sweden.se/society/health-care-in-sweden/), as well as soaring rates of citizen [health](https://sweden.se/society/health-care-in-sweden/) and [happiness](http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2014/09/satisfied-citizens.aspx).

These is only my personal perception of the issue, and it certainly isn't exhaustive. More than anything, I think the most important step we can take is to start having the discussion now, and start thinking of solutions together. Although the technology already exists, it will still be several years for it to start to hit market, and likely a decade or two until it takes over. The first step is awareness.
