## Ethical Questions and Human Life

The most common ethical question involving autonomous vehicles has to do with the life of humans and should a robot have the control to dictate who to harm in certain situations. Although it is highly unlikely that a self-driving car will encounter these decisions it is the main reason why people are against or question autonomous vehicles. 

### Car Companies

What are car and tech companies doing to best respond to these ethical questions that a self-driving car could potentially have to make? What makes these ethical questions so hard for companies to agree on is because there is not a clear set of ethical rules that society follows in their everyday lives.  In a survey<sup>[1](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6293/1573)</sup> published in _Science_ it showed that people tend to agree that everyone would be better off if autonomous vehicles were utilitarian in their driving decisions. However, these same people have a personal incentive to ride in vehicles that will protect the at all costs. Few people would be willing to ride in utilitarian autonomous vehicles, even though they would prefer others to do so. Unfortunately, the problem with autonomous vehicles is that each company is following different ethical theories when writing the code for self-driving cars. 
This is clear when examining the ethical frameworks of some companies. For example, in _Mercedes’s Self-Driving Cars Will Kill Pedestrians Over Drivers_<sup>[2](https://www.inverse.com/article/22204-mercedes-benz-self-driving-cars-ai-ethics)</sup> it states that a company manager at Mercedes-Benz will choose to prioritize driver safety over pedestrians. Stating “It’s safer to save the life you have greater control over.” 

### Statistics

It is evidently clear that cars are dangerous machines that do result in lives being lost. This is probably why most questions have to do with who’s life should be saved in certain trolley problem like scenarios. While these questions are repetitive and tiresome to read it doesn’t mean that these questions shouldn’t be asked. However, it should be noted that self-driving cars are most likely going to be much safer than human drivers. Mercedes’s manager of driver assistance systems states, “Computer-driven cars will be able to react in ways that human drivers will not be able to handle. Besides, most of the time the car will prioritize not crashing in the first place.”<sup>[2](https://www.inverse.com/article/22204-mercedes-benz-self-driving-cars-ai-ethics)</sup>

* Number of Deaths - 35,092  
* Deaths per 100k people - 10.9  

*Estimated Annual Benefits* <sup>[4](https://asp.mercatus.org/system/files/Thierer-Intelligent-Vehicles.pdf)</sup>

| Assumed Adoption Rate | 10 | 50 | 90 |
| --------------------- | -- | -- | -- |
| Lives saved (per year) | 1,100 | 9,600 | 21,700 |
| Fewer crashes | 21,100 | 1,880,000 | 4,220,000 |

When comparing the two tables it is obvious that the estimated lives saved when the adoption rate reaches 90% almost erases the 2015 death totals. It is also safe to assume that injuries and insurance claims would drop as well. So if self-driving cars are so much safer than human drivers than why do we put a heavier burden on the self-driving car than we do with human drivers?

### Driver Impairment

The fact that we put a heavier burden on autonomous vehicles than we do with human drivers is evident in that humans do not always drive in an ethical manner. The top two causes of car deaths were by speeding and drunk driving<sup>[3](http://www.iii.org/issue-update/auto-crashes)</sup>. In fact, 29% of fatalities in crashes were due to drunk driving and 28% of fatalities were from the result of driving too fast. You could conclude that a 100% adoption rate of autonomous vehicles would erase 29% of fatal crashes simply because a computer does not drink alcohol. Furthermore, autonomous vehicles would go a long way to prevent other fatal crashes involving fatigue, talking on a cell phone or other driving distractions that human drivers encounter almost every day.

When we discuss the ethical decisions an autonomous vehicle has to make to save a person’s life one most not forget to mention that since the first autonomous vehicle drove onto the roadways in 2009 there has only been 1 fatal accident involving an autonomous vehicle<sup>[5](https://www.ft.com/content/013d6f46-3f12-11e6-9f2c-36b487ebd80a)</sup> and only 17 minor crashes<sup>[3](http://www.iii.org/issue-update/auto-crashes)</sup>. While there should be more communication between car and tech companies about how their cars will respond to one another, it is more important for people to ask if it is unethical for humans to continue driving.
