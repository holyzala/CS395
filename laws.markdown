## Laws and government intervention needs

### The case for least intervention
There is certainly a policy void in the case of autonomous vehicles, and that may be a good thing. This allows the possibility for a permissionless model that can spur innovation. We can think of this model as a trial and error method. The companies can try things without the worry of laws to begin with. Then if things go wrong, the laws step in to keep things from getting worse. This gives policy makers, and the car companies themselves room and time to figure out what exactly these new technologies are and what they’re capable of. The Thierer/Hagemann paper<sup>1</sup> goes over this model and the opposite in quite a bit of detail. Even so, there are many areas that need a look at even today, we’ll go over a few in the next sections.

### Driver's License
Once vehicles are driving themselves, what's the point of licensing the person? Several states are already starting to tackle this issue by licensing the vehicle instead, but we would need all of them to change their policy to adapt to this new technology.

### Taxes
The government, mostly state, will lose several large sources of income with autonomous vehicles. Fuel taxes will be largerly reduced by the savings that these vehicles could bring. Traffic fines will be nearly eliminated. New means of taxation will need to be explored. Several states are already testing out a per mile driven tax. This could be a good balance of taxation as you would pay proportional to the amount of wear and tear you caused on roadways by driving. Taxes specifically targeting only autonomous vehicles should be avoided as that will slow down adoption. These targeted laws can influence the perception of cost to the consumer. If they pay extra taxes that they didn’t in a regular car, they may not realize that overall it’s still cheaper. All they see is the immediate extra cost.

### Wireless Frequencies
The FCC has restrictions on many of the frequencies that would be needed for inter-car and inter-infrastructure communications. This could be a barrier to several features that could save more time and more fuel. If a car can talk to another car it can determine if it needs to adjust speed or course to accommodate the intentions of the other vehicle. Also, if a car can communicate with the infrastructure, think traffic lights, the infrastructure can make better decisions on how to regulate traffic. Consider the case of the stop light. Pretty much every driver has sat at a stop light wondering why it's red when there are no other cars at the intersection. Sitting there idle at that light is wasted time and wasted gas. If your car could instead let the light know that it's coming ahead of time the light could see there's nobody else in the queue and switch before you got there. With a return message telling your car that you do not have to slow down since it will be green by the time you get there. This isn't restricted to near empty intersections either; if the light knows the intention of each car and how many cars are in each queue, it can make better decisions about how to move traffic through.

### Infrastructure
That traffic light example brings up the next topic. We need those smart stop lights installed, and any other infrastructure that could be made better with information gained from surrounding vehicles. this may be the biggest government cost for autonomous cars, but the savings in lives, time and fuel should more than make up for this one time cost. The Morgan Stanley paper<sup>2</sup> estimates yearly savings around 1.3 trillion dollars.

### Adoption
The government could play a big role in adoption rate. Once the technology is proven it may require legislation to boost the adoption rate. Many people may be hesitant to move to the new technology, and cost reduction incentives could change their minds. This is like what is done for hybrid and electric vehicles.
