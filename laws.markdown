## Laws and government intervention needs

### The case for least intervention
There is certainly a policy void in the case of Autonomous 

### Driver's License
Once vehicles are driving themselves, what's the point of licensing the person? Several states are already starting to tackle this issue, but we would need all of them to change their policy to adapt to this new technology.

### Taxes
The government, mostly state, will lose several large sources of income with autonomous vehicles. Fuel taxes will be largerly reduced by the savings that these vehicles could bring. Traffic fines will be nearly eliminated. 

### Wireless Frequencies
The FCC has restrictions on many of the frequencies that would be needed for inter-car and inter-infrastructure communications. This could be a barrier to several features that could save more time and more fuel. If a car can talk to another car it can determine if it needs to adjust speed or course to accommodate the intentions of the other vehicle. Also, if a car can communicate with the infrastructure, think traffic lights, the infrastructure can make better decisions on how to regulate traffic. Consider the case of the stop light. Pretty much every driver has sat at a stop light wondering why it's red when there are no other cars at the intersection. Sitting there idle at that light is wasted time and wasted gas. If your car could instead let the light know that it's coming ahead of time the light could see there's nobody else in the queue and switch before you got there. With a return message telling your car that you do not have to slow down since it will be green by the time you get there. This isn't restricted to near empty intersections either; if the light knows the intention of each car and how many cars are in each queue, it can make better decisions about how to move traffic through.

## Infrastructure
That traffic light example brings up the next topic. We need those smart stop lights installed, and any other infrastructure that could be made better with information gained from surrounding vehicles. this may be the biggest government cost for autonomous cars, but the savings in lives, time and fuel should more than make up for this one time cost. The Morgan Stanley paper estimates yearly savings around 1.3 trillion dollars.

## Adoption
The government could play a big role in adoption rate. Once the technology is proven with a large adoption rate on its own, it may be needed to legislate that man-driven cars be removed from the road. This may sound extreme, but in order to benefit the most from this new technology we can't have unpredictable humans driving alongside them. This may or may not even be feasible, many people (car enthusiasts especially) will not willing give up their driving privileges.
